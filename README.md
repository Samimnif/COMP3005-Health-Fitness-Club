## Description

The Project is written in python, using the Flask library to run a local webserver.
There are two main components in this project:

1. `database_access.py`: is a python file that contains lots of getter and setter functions that allows me to access the
   database and modify it accordingly. This file also conatins the command line program that gives you an option to
   really quickly access the database through the command line. Although not all functions are implemented in the
   command line program. You can still find the other functions in teh webserver.
2. `main.py`: this python file, starts the flask server in the local port 5000 and will display a website. You can
   navigate through the webserver using the nav bar. You can register a member and access their data.

* To Test the Command line: run `database_access.py`.
* To Test the Webserver: run `main.py`
